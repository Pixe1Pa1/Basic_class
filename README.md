Ratio Class Lab â€“ Unit Testing Demonstration
This repository contains the implementation of a Ratio class (fractions) as part of Lab Assignment #5. The class supports full fraction arithmetic, comparisons, and conversions, along with advanced features such as logging, parsing, and object tracking.

**Key Features Implemented**:
 - Constructors: default, copy, integer, and fraction initialization.
 - Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (with fractions and integers).
 - Comparison operators: equality and ordering.
 - Fraction manipulation: numerator/denominator access, integer and fractional parts, power operations.
 - Type conversions: to integer, floating-point, and string.
 - Object tracking: counting current and total objects.

**Unit Testing**:
 - Full coverage of all class methods using Unit Tests.
 - Test cases include arithmetic, comparisons, conversions, and edge cases.
 - Demonstrates the ability to design, implement, and validate test scenarios efficiently.

This project showcases practical skills in Unit Testing, test case design, and ensuring robust class behavior in C++.
